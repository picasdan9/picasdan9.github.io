## Introduction

In a *Time* article, *Crazy Rich Asians* (2018) is reportedly a momentous win at representation for Asian American. The movie features a Mandarin cover of Coldplay’s song *Yellow*, celebrating the colour as part of the Asian identity (Ho, 2018). Fast forward three years, 88rising, an Asian-America media company, posted a “yellow square” on Instagram to express their solidarity for the affected community in the wake of anti-Asian violence amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It was soon taken down due to purported racism (Song, 2021). These seemingly contradictory events stoke doubts about the meanings of yellow, oscillating between racial derogation and prideful self-identification.

While existing scholarship has scrutinised the ways that Western media represents this community (Ono & Pham, 2009), there is still a lack of critical analysis of how East Asians contest and resist meanings of yellow that are still very much centered around Euro-American epistemology. Utilising Wendy Brown’s concept of “wounded attachments”, I argue that resistance efforts are not only potentially nullified by the enduring centeredness of white consciousness but also made complicated by the evasiveness of non-white epistemology to ground counter-identity claims.

## Historical Perspective

It is imperative to recognise that yellow, when used to index East Asians, is never value-neutral but always relates to certain subjective characterisations of this racial group. Keevak (2011) contends that East Asians were first identified as yellow in 18th-century Western scientific discourse. A racial hierarchy is developed, dichotomizing the healthy-white with the pathological-yellow. In the political sphere, “yellow peril” captures the West’s anxieties towards a terrorising East, owing to collective memories related to  economic competition and warfare.

Generally, East Asians, traditionally blind to their own skin colour, readily take up yellow as a self-marker, arguably due to positive connotations in their cultures. In fact, Chinese diaspora have been described as “Sons of the Yellow Emperor”, referring to the mythical ancestor of all Han people (Keevak, 2011). In the 1960-70s, movements by Asian American to fight for equal footing in the US often made use of yellow in their linguistic and visual articulations with the intention to reclaim this colour (Chow, 2018).

Prevailing societal conceptions of yellow are readily reflected and reinforced in the media. In early 20th-century Western media, Asian characters are often depicted with a distinctive yellow complexion, coupled with a slew of tropes populate: sexual availability and threatening seductiveness of Asian women, and villainy and emasculation of Asian men in relation to white heroism and masculinity (Marchetti, 1994). 

Since the later half of the century, more Asians are in the position to produce media products for global consumption, thus being able to tell their own stories rather than being represented by westerners. Still, remnants of racist media portrayals still persist, such as nerdy and sexually deficient stereotypes (Ono & Pham, 2009).

## Theoretical Standpoint

To navigate around the intricacies of identity politics in contemporary landscape, I shall utilise Wendy Brown’s concept of “wounded attachments” (Brown, 1993). The term refers to liberal movements’ fixation on marginalised groups’ injuries resulting from differences when compared with the white, male middle-class ideal, such as in social acceptance and legal recognition (pp. 394-395). 

Brown’s critique is that attachments to injuries legitimise the centeredness of normativity as the source of woundedness that defines marginalised identities (p. 398). She also warns against the normativising effect of group-minority logics premised on shared experience of injustice that conflates distinctive subjects’ unique, contextual experiences of pain. The marginalised subjects’s deviations from the ideal norm, solidified and made visible through an allegedly shared woundedness, are then reframed through a positivist, disciplinary language of social categories (e.g. race, sexual orientation) upon which equalising treatment is sought in the name of inclusivity and tolerance. The problem with this is, argues Brown, that it makes us lose sight of the discursive operation of institutional power that produces injustice in the first place (p. 399). In effect, the marginalised, too attached to their wounds, are unable to envisage true emancipation - affirmation of a future that entails transformed power structures (p. 399-403). Although Brown does explore ways to overcome this shortcoming, she finds none satisfactory (pp. 406-407). 

Admittedly, Brown’s theorisation is on the extremist side and should be adopted with caution. Still, her critique of the essentialist nature of marginalised identity is incisive. It locates “Asianness” as a normativisng term that collapses the wounded experiences of distinctive marginalised subjects, such as mainland Asians, first-generation immigrant Asians, Western-born Asians. Although this paper sets off to be blind to these varied identities, an acknowledgement of this problematic nature of Asianness would prove crucial to eventual analysis.

## Methodology

Artefacts are collected on the basis that they (1) activate the function of yellow to index East Asians, (2) are produced by East Asians in the late 20th and 21st centuries, and (3) have a primary audience in Western societies. (1) directly addresses the target of this paper, while (2) and (3) set the scope: resistance through self-representation in a field of meanings contested by different racial standpoints.

As this paper only aims to explore rather than generalise, eventually only four artefacts are included, chosen for variety in forms and capacity to converge towards common themes. The process of analysis starts with examining the content, followed by characterising the mechanism of resistance and critiquing it through an understanding of “wounded attachments”.

## Results and Discussion

### Counter-stereotypes and celebration of yellow

The first category of artefacts, which comprise 2018 romcom feature film *Crazy Rich Asian* (from now on *CRA*) and ongoing photography project YELLOW by Zoen Lam, is characterised by their negation of Euro-American stereotypes about East Asians. 

*CRA*, adapted from a novel by America-based Singaporean writer Kevin Kwan, tells the story of Chinese American professor Rachel learning about and navigating in her Singaporean boyfriend’s outrageously wealthy family during a trip to his homeland. It inverts East-West power relations by portraying Asians in the superior position of autonomy and excessive monetary power. For instance, a character remarks “there’s a lot of children starving in America, right?”, parodying the West’s imagination of an inferior East (Wong, 2020). On symbol-building, the movie features a Mandarin cover of Coldplay’s song Yellow to celebrate the colour as a prideful mark of Asian identity, effectively resisting the West’s negative connotations ascribed to it. Indeed, Coldplay initially did not consent to the cover for fear of perceived racism, and only acceded to the request after the director personally explained his vision of the movie (Ho, 2018).

In the same spirit, project *YELLOW* by Zoen Lam, a photographer based in Berlin, seeks to undo the emasculation of Asian men through a “sexy” re-imagination. Muscular Asian men in tiny white briefs are photographed against a saturated yellow background, adorning their complexion with a golden tint (Figure 1 & 2). Their pose exudes confidence, power, and seduction, aided by chiaroscuro lighting that enunciates muscle volumes and a sense of enchanting mystery. In several Instagram posts, photos of the models are paired with snippets of their personal experience overcoming struggles and discrimination as Asians (Figure 2). The soon-to-be-published book is said to feature the stories in their entirety, aiming to portray the characters as role models - yellow men of confidence, resilience, and sexual desirability (Lam, 2020b).

At first glance, these two artefacts seem liberating; the binary oppositions between the inferior, dubious, and emasculated yellow man and the superior, heroic, and masculine Westerner are dismantled, granting Asians an equal footing with Westerners. However, applying the idea of “wounded attachments”, it is clear that counter-stereotypes capitalise on the pain and marginalisation centered around white supremacy, thus risking reinforcing the Western dogma that configures the stereotypes in the first place.
